Package: python-dabroker
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Recommends: python-amqp
Description: Fast distributed object broker for large, mostly-read-only datasets
 DaBroker is short for Data Access Broker.
 .
 DaBroker exposes objects (e.g. database rows, or their NoSQL equivalent, or
 indeed anything you might think of) to clients. Clients cache these objects
 until they do not want them any more, or until they are invalidated by the
 server.
 .
 Multiple servers can run in parallel, for redundancy and increased speed.
 .
 This package contains the Python2 modules for client and server.
