=============================
AMQP exchange/queue structure
=============================

Rationale
=========

The design should be reasonably efficient, i.e. messages don't go where
they're not wanted anyway.

The whole system must be monitor-able. This includes snooping on any RPC
exchange.

Broadcasts may be used. They may even be replied to, i.e. a broadcast
sender might expect many responses. This will aid in discoverability.

RPC messages are read by one client, which will process it and send one
answer. If no client is present, RabbitMQ offers a timeout queue
